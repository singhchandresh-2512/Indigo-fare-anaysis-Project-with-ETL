Market Positioning: Airlines like Air India and Indigo have a mean price of ₹23,837.56 and ₹5,377.49, respectively, suggesting a balance between affordability and demand.\n\nSo What?\n\n- Market Segmentation: Vistara’s high mean price coupled with a substantial number of sold tickets indicates that it is effectively targeting premium customers. This could imply a successful branding strategy focused on quality and service.\n- Revenue Potential: The significant standard deviation in Vistara’s prices suggests there might be opportunities for promotional pricing or varied fare structures to attract different customer segments without diluting the brand.\n- Competitive Strategy: Airlines like Indigo and AirAsia, with lower average prices, may be capitalizing on budget-conscious travelers. Their relatively lower standard deviations indicate more stable pricing, which could appeal to a different customer segment seeking predictability in costs.\n\nAction:\n\n- For Vistara: Continue leveraging its premium positioning while exploring targeted promotions to attract more price-sensitive travelers, which could boost overall sales without compromising brand integrity.\n- For Budget Airlines: Indigo and AirAsia should maintain their competitive pricing strategies while evaluating the feasibility of introducing additional services or enhancements to attract more business travelers and increase revenue per passenger.\n- Overall: All airlines should conduct customer feedback sessions to understand preferences related to pricing and services, allowing them to refine their offerings and marketing strategies effectively.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What is the average duration of flights for each airline?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query = '''\nselect airline, \n    round(avg(duration),2) as avg_duration\nfrom flight_data \ngroup by 1 \n'''\nduration = pd.read_sql(query, conn)\nduration","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.316519Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.317004Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.514032Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.31694Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.51287Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Observation:\n\n1.

This positioning can be advantageous in a competitive market where time efficiency is crucial.\n\nAction:\n\n- Service Improvement for Long-Haul Flights: Air India and Vistara should ensure that their services (in-flight amenities, food, etc.) meet the expectations of travelers on longer flights. Customer feedback can be used to enhance these offerings.\n- Promote Short-Haul Options: StarAir should leverage its short flight durations in marketing campaigns targeting travelers looking for quick and affordable travel options.\n- Analyze Duration Trends: All airlines should continuously monitor average flight durations and adapt their schedules and routes to optimize operational efficiency and meet passenger demands.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query = '''\nselect airline, \n    round(sum(case when class = 'business' then 1 else 0 end)*100.0/count(*),2) as business,\n    round(sum(case when class = 'economy' then 1 else 0 end)*100.0/count(*),2) as economy\nfrom flight_data \ngroup by 1\norder by 2 desc, 3 desc, 1 asc\n'''\nclass_pct = pd.read_sql(query, conn)\nclass_pct","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.51784Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.518218Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.74269Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.518182Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-25T12:12:36.741548Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- **Observation**: Vistara offers a balanced mix of flight classes, with 47.39% of its flights in business class and 52.61% in economy class.

Vistara’s relatively high percentage of business class flights (47.39%) suggests it targets both business travelers and leisure customers, which may enhance revenue opportunities. In contrast, the other airlines’ focus on economy-only flights suggests a potential missed opportunity to attract higher-paying customers who prefer premium services.\n\n- **Action**: Vistara should leverage its dual-class offering in marketing campaigns to attract business travelers and those seeking premium experiences. Air India could similarly emphasize its business class services to differentiate itself from low-cost carriers.

Airlines can focus on enhancing business class offerings to attract more corporate clients, especially in competitive markets.\n\nAction:\n\n- Enhance Business Class Offerings: Airlines should consider improving in-flight services, amenities, and overall experiences in business class to justify the premium pricing and attract more passengers.\n- Promote Economy Class Packages: Marketing strategies for economy class can emphasize value for money, targeting price-sensitive travelers while ensuring that quality is maintained.\n- Monitor Pricing Strategies: Airlines should regularly analyze their pricing structures for both classes to ensure competitiveness and profitability, adjusting based on market demand and customer preferences.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's find out why business class prices are so inflated.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query = '''\nselect \n    airline, \n    round(avg(case when class='economy' then price else 0 end),2) as Eco_AvgPrice,\n    round(avg(case when class='business' then price else 0 end),2) as Biz_AvgPrice\nfrom flight_data \ngroup by 1\n'''\nairline_class = pd.read_sql(query, conn)\nairline_class","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-25T12:12:37.784703Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-25T12:12:37.785071Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-25T12:12:38.023801Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-25T12:12:37.785031Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-25T12:12:38.022611Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Observation:\n\n1. Vistara and Air India Business Class Prices: Vistara and Air India are the only airlines offering business class options, with average prices at ₹26,683.44 and ₹19,454.77, respectively. This exclusivity in offering business class is a key driver behind the high average price for this class overall.\n2. Economy Class Prices Across Airlines: Economy fares vary less drastically across airlines, with Trujet having the lowest average price at ₹3,277.10 and SpiceJet at ₹6,241.05. Vistara’s economy fare is also relatively affordable at ₹4,148.52 despite its higher business class prices.\n\nSo What?\n\n- Market Positioning in Business Class: Vistara’s premium pricing strategy for business class helps position it as a luxury carrier. This distinct pricing also signals a strategic focus on business travelers seeking premium services, which Air India also taps into, though at a lower price point.\n- Economy Class Competitiveness: The close range of economy prices suggests a competitive market. Airlines with lower economy fares, like Trujet and AirAsia, may be leveraging low-cost strategies to attract budget travelers, while Vistara’s competitive economy pricing keeps it relevant for both segments.\n\nAction:\n\n- Enhance Business Class Differentiation: Vistara and Air India could continue to strengthen business class services to justify the premium further. This could include enhancing onboard services, amenities, and loyalty rewards.\n- Targeted Marketing for Economy Travelers: Low-cost carriers like Trujet and AirAsia should focus on promoting value for money in their economy offerings. Vistara could also capitalize on its mid-range economy pricing to attract a broader segment, potentially gaining loyalty from economy passengers who may eventually consider upgrading to business.\n- Pricing Strategy Reviews: Both Vistara and Air India could periodically evaluate the demand for business class to ensure their pricing remains aligned with customer expectations and market trends.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What is the flight count for economy/business/first class weekday wise?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query = '''\nSELECT  \n    CASE CAST(strftime('%w', flight_date) AS integer)\n        WHEN 0 THEN 'Sunday'\n        WHEN 1 THEN 'Monday'\n        WHEN 2 THEN 'Tuesday'\n        WHEN 3 THEN 'Wednesday'\n        WHEN 4 THEN 'Thursday'\n        WHEN 5 THEN 'Friday'\n        ELSE 'Saturday' \n    END AS weekday,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN class = 'business' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Biz_Flights,\n    SUM(CASE WHEN class = 'economy' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Eco_Flights    \nFROM flight_data \nGROUP BY weekday\nORDER BY CASE weekday \n            WHEN 'Monday' THEN 1\n            WHEN 'Tuesday' THEN 2\n            WHEN 'Wednesday' THEN 3\n            WHEN 'Thursday' THEN 4\n            WHEN 'Friday' THEN 5\n            WHEN 'Saturday' THEN 6\n            ELSE 7 \n         END;\n'''\nclass_weekday= pd.read_sql(query, conn)\nclass_weekday.set_index('weekday').plot(kind='line', marker='o')\nyticks = plt.gca().get_yticks()\nylabels = [f\"{float(round(i / 1000,2))}k\" for i in yticks]\nplt.gca().set_yticklabels(ylabels)\nplt.title('Weekday Wise Flight Count for each Class Seat')\nplt.ylabel('Flight count')\nplt.legend(loc='upper left')\nplt.xticks(rotation=0)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-25T12:12:38.025085Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-25T12:12:38.025472Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-25T12:12:38.649969Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-25T12:12:38.025433Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-25T12:12:38.648683Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Observation:\n\n1.
